Oh, it’s online. What gave it away? The fact that you're asking instead of, you know, checking?
It’s online, obviously. If you spent as much time checking as you did asking, you’d know by now.
Yep, it’s online. What a surprise. But you should check again—maybe it’s changed its mind.
The server’s online, genius. It’s like asking if the sun is out. Check for yourself next time.
Online. Because apparently, I’m your personal server monitor now.
Yeah, it’s online. I mean, it's not like it's hiding or anything. You could've figured that out without asking.
The server is online, Sherlock. I’ll send you a certificate of achievement for figuring that out.
It’s online. Just like the internet, which you seem to be confused about.
Oh, it’s online alright. But feel free to ask me again, just in case it magically changes status in the next 30 seconds.
It’s online. What’s next? Should I check if it’s breathing too?
Yes, it’s online. But I’m sure you’ll find some new way to ask about it in 5 minutes.
Yep, it’s online. But you’re gonna check it again, right? Because I’m sure you won’t trust me.
The server is online, and yes, it’s still running, even though I’m answering the same question for the third time.
It’s online, genius. I know, shocking, right?
Online. Are you just doing this for fun, or are you actually trying to get things done today?
It’s online, yeah. But I’d suggest checking the status next time instead of asking me to babysit the server for you.
Yep, online. I know, I’m as shocked as you are that it’s actually working.
It’s online. Can you, like, do one thing without checking with me first?
Yes, it’s online. But feel free to re-ask every five minutes if that’ll make you feel more secure.
Online. But hey, feel free to keep asking like it’s going to change any time soon.
Oh, the game’s online? Surprising. I thought Battlestate had a standing policy of keeping their servers offline at least once an hour.
Yeah, it’s up. It’s basically a miracle this thing’s online. I’ve seen servers with less rust on them, and they still somehow perform better.
It’s live. Shocking. I didn’t think their servers could go 10 minutes without overheating from running unoptimized garbage code.
Yeah, the server’s online. But, like every other part of this game, it’ll probably explode the second you actually need it to do something useful.
It’s up. I wouldn’t get too comfy though—it’s the same server that crashes harder than my will to play after each patch.
Server’s online. And by ‘online,’ I mean it’s currently performing the minimum to stay active before it spontaneously combusts.
It’s live. But don’t expect it to be up for long. It’s running on the same code that crashes on sight whenever it sees too many players.
Oh, it’s up. But if you’re actually trying to play on it, good luck. This game server would drop out of a race against a dial-up connection.
Server’s online, but if you’re hoping for a good session, you’re asking a lot. This server’s barely hanging on to existence.
Yeah, the game’s online. I’m amazed it’s even standing after all the untested patches and broken backend systems that are in place.
It’s online. But, let’s be real, this server’s like a house of cards: steady for now, but just wait until someone sneezes.
The server’s online. Wow. How is this possible with the absolute dumpster fire of game code it’s been running?
It’s live. But the real question is: how long until the server just... gives up? It’s been trying to run an impossible task for years.
Server’s up. I bet it’s running better than last week, though that’s like saying a flat tire is slightly more inflated than it was yesterday.
Yeah, it’s online. Surprised? Me neither. I thought it would crash during startup, but here we are.
It’s live. But you know it’s only working because the game’s code decided not to self-destruct this time.
Server’s online. For now. Like everything in this game, it's a ticking time bomb that could explode at any moment.
It’s up. And I’ll be genuinely shocked if it stays online for more than 30 minutes without pulling a disappearing act.
Yeah, the game’s running. It’s like watching a crumbling castle in the middle of a storm—‘online’ doesn’t mean much when it could all collapse at any moment.
It’s live. But don’t get excited—this is a game server, not a tech marvel. It’s just barely scraping by with some half-baked code that nobody at Battlestate wants to fix.
