Offline, genius. Maybe check before you ask next time?
It’s offline. Shocking, right? I’m sure you didn’t expect that, but there it is.
Offline, obviously. It’s like you’re waiting for it to magically turn on because you asked nicely.
It’s offline. But you’re probably already planning to ask again in five minutes, aren’t you?
Offline. What a revelation, huh? Feel free to let me know when you figure out why.
The server’s offline. You could have deduced that yourself if you looked at the error message.
Offline. I know, it’s a hard concept to grasp. Maybe the server’s on strike?
Yeah, it’s offline. You’re welcome for answering something you could’ve checked.
Offline. But hey, you should try asking it to come back online, like that’ll work.
Offline. Again. But I’m sure the server has a very good reason for this inconvenience.
It’s offline. I’m sorry that it’s not actively serving your needs 24/7 like some kind of magical unicorn.
Offline, as expected. Servers don’t work on demand, you know.
Offline. But don’t worry, I’ll write it a letter to let it know you need it back online immediately.
It’s offline, obviously. What were you expecting? A miracle?
Offline. Just the way you like it, huh? Servers are always more fun when they’re not working.
Offline. You’re lucky you even got an answer, to be honest.
The server’s offline. Who would’ve thought, huh?
Offline. But feel free to ask again in another 10 minutes, maybe it’ll change its mind.
Offline. Not like that’s any surprise, right?
Yeah, it’s offline. I’d recommend turning it on, but, you know, it’s not my job to teach you everything.
Offline? Yeah, it's offline, but it’s probably just the server doing its daily ritual of silently screaming into the void before crashing into oblivion.
Server’s offline. Shocked? I’m not. It’s like this thing has a personal vendetta against staying up for more than 15 minutes.
Offline. Again. The server’s got a better track record for going down than Battlestate has for fixing bugs. No surprise there.
It’s offline. I swear, if it were any more fragile, it’d be a wet tissue paper under a light breeze. These servers crash harder than my soul during a Tarkov wipe.
Offline. Like the server itself is trying to escape the chaos that is its own code. Who can blame it?
Yep, it’s offline. Probably hit some edge case that no one bothered to account for because, you know, testing is overrated.
The server’s offline. Shocking, right? Honestly, I’d be more surprised if it was up for more than an hour without throwing itself into a pit of self-doubt and failure.
Offline. Again. It’s like they gave up on uptime a while ago and just let the server freefall into oblivion every few hours.
It’s offline. This thing drops faster than my hopes for a working fix after every patch.
Server’s down. Honestly, I’m more surprised when it’s up than when it’s down. At least when it’s down, I don’t have to pretend it’s reliable.
Offline. Can we just take a moment to appreciate that this is the same server I pay to keep running? Incredible, really.
It’s offline. Honestly, this server is probably just tired of running code that no one should’ve expected to work.
Server’s offline. At this point, I wouldn’t be shocked if it just decided to quit its day job and go live a quiet life in the middle of nowhere.
It’s offline. Must’ve hit a NULL pointer or tried to parse something that wasn’t even remotely close to being valid. Classic.
Offline. Maybe it just gave up. Can’t say I blame it.
It’s offline. Maybe it got tired of being a glorified dumpster fire and decided to just roll over and die.
Server’s down. If you want reliability, try checking the weather—at least that’s more predictable than these servers.
Offline. It’s like Battlestate actively goes out of its way to ensure their servers go down at the worst possible moments.
