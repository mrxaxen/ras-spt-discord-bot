Offline? Of course, it’s offline. It’s like Battlestate’s official state of being—more offline than it is ever online. Might as well call it ‘permanently down for maintenance.’
Yeah, it’s offline. Surprise, surprise. I’m honestly shocked it wasn’t offline the moment you asked. Guess they didn’t hit the ‘shutdown’ button hard enough this time.
The server’s offline. You know, like every time they ‘fix’ something and accidentally break a hundred more things. Classic.
Offline? Yeah, it’s offline. Like, Battlestate servers aren’t ever reliably up for long. Every time it says ‘online,’ it’s just tricking you into getting your hopes up.
It’s offline. Probably for the best, honestly. If it were up, you’d just be dealing with infinite loading screens and a connection that drops more than my trust in their devs.
Server’s down. At least it has the decency to be consistent. It’s offline almost as often as the servers are actually running—so, basically, always.
Offline? Yeah, it’s taking a break. Probably overwhelmed by how bad the code is—who can blame it?
The game’s offline. I’m just waiting for Battlestate to come out with their next big excuse for why the server’s down again. Something like, ‘we were just rebooting the infinite loop of failure.'
Offline. Honestly, at this point, I’m convinced the server is just tired of running something so broken. I get it.
It’s offline. You’d think Battlestate would have sorted this out by now, but here we are—waiting for a server to realize it’s supposed to be running.
Oh yeah, the server’s down. Guess it needed a nap to recover from the trauma of running code that should’ve been abandoned five years ago.
It’s offline. As usual. The only thing more consistent than this game crashing is the promise that their servers will go down at some point.
Offline. It’s like the server is doing its best to avoid the dumpster fire that is its own backend. I respect that.
It’s offline. You’d think they’d keep the servers running, but I guess they prefer turning them off and pretending that everything’s fine.
Server’s offline. I wouldn’t even be surprised if Battlestate themselves had to reboot the whole thing manually. Just the kind of thing they’d do.
It’s offline. Honestly, if I were a server running this game’s code, I’d want to quit too.
Offline. It’s like a tradition at this point—game’s up for a few minutes, then poof—it’s gone. Just like the servers every other week.
Offline? Oh yeah, but don’t worry—it’s not like we were expecting to actually play today. Server down, devs don’t care, same old story.
It’s offline. If you thought it was going to be smooth sailing today, you’re clearly not familiar with Battlestate’s ‘standard operating procedures.’
Oh, it’s offline? Well, what a shocker. Another day, another server down. If I had a dollar for every time this game went offline, I could buy a server that actually works.
