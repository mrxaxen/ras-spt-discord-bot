    "first": "Stop the server? Because making it die is obviously the solution to all our problems.",

    "first": "Stop the server? Sure. Why not? It’s not like I have anything better to do.",
    "final": "Done. It’s stopped. Hopefully, you’ve got some *really* good reasoning for this."
  },
  {
    "first": "Stop the server? Sure, I’ll just go ahead and cut its life support. No big deal.",
    "final": "It’s stopped. You can bask in the glory of your decision now."

    "first": "Oh, so now we’re stopping the server? Because that’s what makes *total sense* right now.",
    "final": "It’s off. The world’s not going to end. Yet."
