Yeah, it's online... for now. I mean, it's basically the equivalent of a broken clock that somehow shows the right time twice a day. Don’t get attached.
Oh sure, it’s online. But who knows for how long? The last time it ran for more than 10 minutes without crashing, Battlestate was still pretending they had a working server infrastructure.
Yep, it’s up. Barely. Honestly, I’ve seen more stable connections in a dial-up lobby. It’s only alive because it doesn’t know how to die yet.
Online? Yeah, it’s online, but I swear the backend’s just playing chicken with the universe at this point. Any second now, it’s gonna go down like every other server that was 'fixed' last week.
It’s up, but if you’re expecting it to last, you’re as optimistic as someone trusting a Tarkov patch to ‘fix all the bugs.’
Yep, online. But you know it’s a miracle it’s still standing. Running this server is like driving a rusted car on square wheels.
Online. But I’d start praying for it. It’s probably two milliseconds away from collapsing under the weight of its own spaghetti code.
It’s online, yeah, but at this point, it’s less 'up' and more 'hoping for the best.' If it survives a full session, I’ll be shocked.
Yep, it’s online. Just don’t try to do anything complicated. The backend is as stable as a house of cards in a wind tunnel.
It’s online. No clue how, but as a programmer, I know nothing should be running like this. If you ask me, it’s hanging on by sheer incompetence.
Server’s up... for now. At this point, I feel like I’m watching a dumpster fire that refuses to go out.
Yeah, it’s running. I just hope it doesn’t explode the second you try to interact with it—because, honestly, it's like pushing a boulder uphill made of broken JavaScript and bad API calls.
It’s online. But if you want stability, you’re playing the wrong game. This thing couldn’t hold a connection if it was glued together with duct tape and hope.
Oh yeah, it’s online. That’s actually impressive. I expected it to spontaneously implode from the sheer weight of its bugs, but here we are.
The server’s online, but I’d be willing to bet it has no idea what it’s doing. It's like the server itself is reading the code and saying, 'WTF did they think this was gonna do?'
It’s up. But I honestly don’t know how. You could replace the server code with a potato and get the same results.
Yeah, it’s online. At this point, this server’s the digital equivalent of a rusty spoon. It does the job, but you don’t want to use it for anything important.
It’s live. For now. And in case you’re wondering, ‘how?’—I don’t know either. But somehow, it is.
The server’s online. But it’s the kind of ‘online’ that can disappear without warning—just like Battlestate’s ‘stable’ updates.
