Oh, it’s restarting, alright. Probably because it realized the last 10 crashes weren’t enough to make it feel alive again.
Yeah, it’s restarting. It’s like a bad horror movie—you know it’s going to come back, but you’re not sure whether it’ll be better or worse.
Server’s rebooting. If it even starts after this, I’ll consider it a win. Just don’t hold your breath—it’s about as likely as Battlestate fixing a game-breaking bug.
It’s restarting. I’d love to be optimistic, but this thing’s more likely to come back worse than before, like a patched bug that’s just moved to a new location.
The server’s restarting. Maybe this time it won’t try to implode on itself mid-session, but don’t bet your last rouble on it.
Server’s rebooting. It’s like resetting a broken toy that always comes back with a new glitch every time you try to play with it.
Restarting. I’m putting my money on it failing immediately, but who knows, maybe this time it’ll come back less broken than last time.
Server’s restarting. Yeah, because that’s been working so far. I’m on the edge of my seat waiting for it to make it past the loading screen without crashing.
It’s restarting. The server’s like a tired worker who keeps getting called back to fix a job they never should’ve taken in the first place.
Restarting. Maybe it’ll come back more stable, maybe it won’t. At this point, I’m just watching a train wreck in slow motion.
It’s rebooting. Yeah, because that’s really going to solve everything. Let me know when it’s actually back up without throwing a tantrum.
Server’s restarting. Let’s pray it doesn’t come back worse. But honestly, I’d bet money it’s about to drop like a hot potato the second it finishes.
It’s restarting. Same old song and dance. Maybe this time it’ll stay up for more than an hour, maybe not.
Restarting. If I had a nickel for every time this server ‘restarted,’ I’d be able to afford a better game—one with, you know, working servers.
Server’s rebooting. Great. It’s like a hamster on a wheel—going nowhere fast, but doing it with determination.
It’s restarting. Will it work? I don’t know, but I’m not putting my faith in it. This is Battlestate, after all.
Server’s restarting. Let’s all pretend like this reboot is actually going to fix the decade-old mess of code running it.
